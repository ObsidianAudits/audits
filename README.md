## Testimonials
> Working with Obsidian has been a great experience. Their audit was incredibly thorough, highly professional, and showed deep attention to details. The quality of their security review stood out â€” two independent follow-up audits found only a small number of additional issues, highlighting Obsidianâ€™s strong coverage and expertise. Weâ€™re excited to keep working with Juan and Spearmint for our future security reviews and make them one of our go-to security partner.
